## Reporting a vulnerability

We take security bugs seriously.
We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/joeig/go-powerdns/security/advisories/new) tab.
We will triage the issue, and work with you on a coordinated disclosure timeline.
